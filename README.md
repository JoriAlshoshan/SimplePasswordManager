# Simple Password Manager

This is a basic console application written in C# designed to help users securely store and manage their passwords on their own computer.

## How It Works

- When you run the program for the first time, it asks you to create a **Master Key**. This key protects all your stored passwords.
- Your passwords for different websites or applications are saved encrypted in a local text file.
- Every time you open the program afterward, you must enter the correct Master Key to unlock and access your saved passwords.

## Features

- List all saved passwords
- Add new passwords or update existing ones
- Retrieve a password for a specific website or app
- Delete passwords you no longer need
